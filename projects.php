                    Here you can find some of the projects I have started, some finished, some still in the works!
                    I use my projects to test new technologies that I have learned about, to gain a deeper understanding 
                    of certain concepts and to fulfill my desire to learn.
                    You can click on the images of each project and view more details, or go to the GitHub page to view the code first-hand. Some projects
                    may not be added or fully developed yet as the website is still under construction. I want to make sure the website has full functionality before
                    adding all of the content. Thanks for looking!
