<span class="subtitle3">UNION ASSISTANT | KENT STUDENT UNION | 25/05/2018 - PRESENT</span>
<p>
    In the retail sector of Kent Union’s non-profit shop on campus, I work independently and manage my own time to get tasks done within the frame of my shift. Liaising with managers and supervisors on a regular basis to ensure they are kept up to date and can organise the other staff where needed. 
</p>
<span class="subtitle3">STOCK CONTROL OPERATOR | TESCO | 18/06/2018 - 09/09/2018</span>
<p>
This role tested my ability to work under pressure and prioritise tasks throughout the day. Time management was key to success as each section of the store had to be searched and reduced if needed within a small timeframe. Concise and effective communication with the section staff was also required so that they can efficiently replenish stock. 
</p>
<span class="subtitle3">DOMESTIC ELECTRICIAN | INDEPENDENT | 09/10/15 - 03/01/17</span>
<p>
    While also working at Waitrose, as a newly fully qualified electrician I worked in teams of all sizes alongside people of all trades, some self-employed, some contracted. From wiring houses to preparing trunking and conduit. This role taught me how to communicate and translate terminology from detailed designs to those who are less knowledgeable of the schematics. Presenting schedules to builders allowing us to work simultaneously and not interfere with each other. I have gained experience in how professional teams work in the trades industry from these experiences, which I can transfer to the office.
</p>
<span class="subtitle3">RETAL ASSISTANT | WAITROSE | 19/08/13 - 28/08/18</span>
<p>
    Within Waitrose supermarket at Sudbury I worked as a part-time Ambient partner. This customer facing role required me to manage my electrical training and career with shift commitments. Building a good rapport with regular customers and co-workers, allowing me to resolve conflicts within the team easier and help regular customers faster by understanding them as a person. When leading the team, I used initiative and experience to make decisions on how our team can work more efficiently by deciding what needed to be prioritised and how to approach the tasks. I also worked on Customer Services when customer demand required, using the checkout to finalize customers shopping and payments or assist in customer queries.

<h2 class="subtitle2">Interests</h2>    
<section class="content_body dark-wrapper">
<span class="subtitle3">SPORTS</span>
<p>
My sporty technical skills come from having good hand eye coordination, at least, when I have my contact lenses in. I play field hockey at university in the sweeper position, I am the last defender before the goal, focusing on the ball and controlling the defenders in front of me is my role for 70 minutes. Table-tennis and Pool are some other activities that I enjoy. 
</p>
<span class="subtitle3">TECHNOLOGY</span>
<p>
	Competing in online games, rivalled by my older brothers with the motivation to be better than them, which I did. I joined an online community in 2012, taking on a leadership role, setting up our Linux Counter-Strike servers, organising events, and assisting in testing new python plugins before they were introduced to the public.
	I also enjoy watching a variety of channels on twitch, seeing how other people’s interests and creativity can create content for others. Even learning how things are created and watching people code in programming languages I have never used, which inspired me to use C# in ASP.NET to create a simple interview webpage for my community when I was younger.

        <p>The skills used in this project are: Java, JavaSwing, determination, perseverance, and my own curiosity which lead to the birth of this project.</p> 
</section>
<section class="content_body light-wrapper">
        <p>In my spare time I decided to teach myself how to uses GUI's in java, this was outside
            of the university curriculum but I felt it was very much an important thing to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not perfect by any means I have created a memory game for the user to copy the sequences shown to them
            by flashing colours, there are levels that get harder for each one you pass, and there are difficulties
            for those who feel they are the master of memory.
            </p>
            <p>Still under development during my free time I plan to move the Jframes which are created for each
                part of the game to panels, as I have come to learn that this would be the more appropriate, and efficient
                way of programming with the use of JAVASWING.
