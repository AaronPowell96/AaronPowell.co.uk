<span class="subtitle3">UNION ASSISTANT | KENT STUDENT UNION | April 2018 - PRESENT</span>
<p>
In the retail sector of Kent Union’s non-profit shop on campus, I work independently and manage my own time to get tasks done efficiently and to a high standard. I liaise with managers and supervisors on a regular basis to ensure they are kept up to date on my work to ensure everyone is working towards the same goal. 
</p>
<span class="subtitle3">STOCK CONTROL OPERATOR | TESCO | June 2018 - Sept 2018</span>
<p>
This role tested my ability to work under pressure and prioritise tasks throughout the day. Time management was key to success, as each section of the store had to be searched and reduced when required within a small timeframe. Concise and effective communication with the section staff was also required so that they can efficiently replenish stock.
</p>
<span class="subtitle3">DOMESTIC ELECTRICIAN | INDEPENDENT | Oct 2015 - Jan 2017</span>
<p>
While also working at Waitrose, as a newly fully qualified electrician I worked in teams of all sizes alongside people of many trades, some self-employed, some contracted. From wiring houses to preparing trunking and conduit. This role taught me how to communicate and translate terminology from detailed designs to plain English, to those who are less knowledgeable of the schematics. Presenting time schedules to builders, allowing us to work simultaneously and not interfere with each other. I have gained many valuable transferable skills from my time as an electrician of which I look forward to bringing with me to my placement.
</p>
<span class="subtitle3">RETAL ASSISTANT | WAITROSE | Aug 2013 - Aug 2018</span>
<p>
Within Waitrose supermarket at Sudbury I worked as a part-time Ambient partner. This customer facing role required me to balance my electrical training and career with shift commitments. Building a good rapport with regular customers and co-workers, allowing me to resolve conflicts within the team easier and help regular customers faster by understanding them as a person. When supervising the team, I used initiative and experience to make decisions on how our team can work more efficiently by listening to others and deciding what needed to be prioritised. I also worked on Customer Services when demand required, using the checkout to finalize customers shopping and payments, or assist in customer queries.

<h2 class="subtitle2">Interests</h2>    
<section class="content_body dark-wrapper">
<span class="subtitle3">SPORTS</span>
<p>
My sport ability comes only from having good hand eye coordination, at least, when I have my contact lenses in! I play field hockey at university in the sweeper position, I am the last defender before the goal, focusing on the ball and controlling the defenders in front of me is my role for 70 minutes. Table-tennis and Pool are some other activities that I enjoy in my spare-time.
</p>
<span class="subtitle3">TECHNOLOGY</span>
<p>
Competing in online games from a young age, rivalled by my older brothers, with the motivation to be better than them, which I did. I joined an online community in 2012, taking on a leadership role, setting up our Linux Counter-Strike servers, organising events, and assisting in testing new python plugins before they were introduced to the public.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy watching a variety of content on Twitch, seeing other people’s interests and creativity create enjoyable content. Learning how things are made, crafts, and watching people code, which was my inspiration to use C# in ASP.NET to create a simple interview webpage for my community before I even had the goal of becoming a software developer.

        <p>The skills used in this project are: Java, JavaSwing, determination, perseverance, and my own curiosity which lead to the birth of this project.</p> 
</section>
<section class="content_body light-wrapper">
        <p>In my spare time I decided to teach myself how to uses GUI's in java, this was outside
            of the university curriculum but I felt it was very much an important thing to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not perfect by any means I have created a memory game for the user to copy the sequences shown to them
            by flashing colours, there are levels that get harder for each one you pass, and there are difficulties
            for those who feel they are the master of memory.
            </p>
            <p>Still under development during my free time I plan to move the Jframes which are created for each
                part of the game to panels, as I have come to learn that this would be the more appropriate, and efficient
                way of programming with the use of JAVASWING.
