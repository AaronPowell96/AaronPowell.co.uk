                        I grew up in the countryside village of Great Cornard, in the town of Sudbury Suffolk. A 30 minutes drive to Colchester,
                        Essex, which you're more likely to have heard of.. I was surrounded by a beautifully scenic countryside with a small town
                        which consisted of quite a few locally owned businesses and not so many big brand shops.

                        Most of my social time would be playing football with friends or building dens and tree houses,
                        I enjoyed riding my bicycle, hitting jumps, until I had an accident which consequently left me in hospital for two weeks, and severe internal damage.
                        Luckily, I fully recovered and now ride my bike casually to get from A to B.

                       I joined my local football club (Cornard Dynamos) at the age of 6, being the "Most Improved Player" of 2003. However,
                       I'm still not sure whether that is because I was bad to begin with or because I actaully improved...
                       I continued playing football (changing clubs and then back to Cornard Dynamos again) until the age of 14, 
                       where I turned to field hockey. <p>Playing on the nearby astro-turf I played for Sudbury Hockey Club and 
                       my school (Great Cornard Upper School), following this through to university I joined the hockey society where I played as
                       a sweeper, being the last line of defense. I was the last line of defense. <br/> <br/>
                       Oh, and I can't forget that I saved a penalty against my brother in a shootout where I actually broke my arm from saving it.

                    Growing up with four older brothers, they gave me exposure to games early in my life. That introduction had a great impact, meaning
                    that games for the most part of my life has been essential, playing genres like arcade, roleplay, first person shooters, and MMOs, from then to this present day. I have
                    been apart of competitive teams in Counter-Strike 1.6, Counter-Strike: Source, CSGO, Overwatch, and Call of Duty 4: Promod.
<p>
                    Winning two community tournaments in CS 1.6 and multiple CSGO FaceIt weekend tournaments. As I progressed into university, I
                    decided to put these commitments to the side and focus on my studies, my career.

                    Being in a leadership role for the Counter-Strike section of my community, I tested and debugged python plugins which were used
                    to run events with the public players. I enjoyed finding these bugs and throughly testing the creations of our developers, which 
                    I believe also prompted my curiosity for programming, as I looked up to these developers.
